# Solid Principles

This repo is the backup material for the blog post on [Solid Principles](put.link.in.here).

It has three packages showing different stages of a solution:

* **leantech.com.stage.one**: This shows a first implementation of a "social network" bypassing several software principles.
* **leantech.com.stage.two**: This shows a second approach, following the open-closed principle, but leaving many design issues unresolved.
* **leantech.com.stage.fixed**: This shows the final approach, a refactor of the solution driven the SOLID principles.

The logic is really simple and the only intention is to examplify a use case, for that reason classes from the package **leantech.com.db** have mocks representing **SQL** and **NoSQL** databases.

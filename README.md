# Solid Principles

This repo is the backup material for the blog post on [Solid Principles](put.link.in.here).

It has three packages showing different stages of a solution:

* leantech.com.stage.one: This shows a first implementation of a "social network" by passing several software principles.
* leantech.com.stage.two: This shows a second approach, following the open-closed principle, but leaving many design issues unresolve.
* leantech.com.stage.fixed: This shows the final approach, a refactor of the solution following the SOLID principles.

The logic is really simple and the only intention is to examplify a use case, for that reason classes from the package leantech.com.db have mocks representing SQL and NoSQL databases.
